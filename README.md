# DL-Based-Feature-Selection

Reimplementations for Deep-Learning-Based Feature Selection.

My main task is to analyse the new non-linear feature selection method and reimplement it using TensorFlow from the original model by PyTorch. Which helps me to understand better about the structure of both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
